    "intro": "Components, directives, pipes are declared once and only once in an NgModule. The same component/direcive/pipe cannot be declared in multiple modules. NgModules/component/directives/pipes can be exported by your module. But only other NgModules can be imported into your module.",
    "example": [
        "shared-person.module is a ngModule which has UpdatePrivateComponent & UpdatePersonComponent components.",
        "It has input and out directives.",
        "When enter a new name it will update array and display in the list."
